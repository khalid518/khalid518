I'm Khalid, a software developer based in Nigeria.
I enjoy building web applications that are not just functional, but clean, efficient, and user-friendly. I like turning ideas into real products and solving problems through code.
I work mostly with Laravel, Reac and MySQL.
I have built projects such as an asset management system, an e-commerce platform and loan application.
I’m open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and interesting tech conversations.
